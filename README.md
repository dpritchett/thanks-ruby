# Thanks

![download counter link at rubygems](https://img.shields.io/gem/dt/rails.svg)

Find out how to support the authors of the gems you depend on. Inspired by @feross's "thanks" package for Node.

TODO: 

- Tests
- Get list of gems for local context
- Get gems from gemspec
- Get gems from Gemfile
- Add your donation linkt to the registry

Help wanted! This is free of course :)

## Installation

Install this directly:

`$ gem install thanks`

And then execute:

```sh
$ thanks_rb

Sweet! You are using gems with donation pages!

 - bundler	https://rubytogether.org
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the Thanks projectâ€™s codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/[USERNAME]/thanks/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
